We are constructing a Meditation app, using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

App consists of a video backgrund which can be changed to adpat the season currently going in real life.
Four buttons on the right arrannged in a column are used to change seasons of the background, winter, spring summer and autum respectively.
The row of buttons at the bottom are used to set time for the meditation timer. The time as 10s, 2min, 5min, 10min and 20min from left to right.
According to the time a timer is shown in the section above the time buttons, consisting of pause button (||) and timer clock and strat button (>).
On clicking time buttons we can set the time for timer. A click on strat button start the timer, and a sound start playing along with a progress bar in the timer,
The screen hides cursor and all the buttons baring only audio and video if the cursor is set untouched for a lil amount of time.

Also this app is responsive. The above description of having buttons on right or button was for device having desktop. For devices such as mobile phones, the seasons button are rooled inside a menu button, 
which opens up the season buttons when clicked, and closes the season buttons bar when clicked again.
